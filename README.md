# Droplets

**Manage and connect small droplets of information**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pekoe09/droplets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pekoe09/droplets)

Droplets is a simple system for noting down small pieces of information, creating connections between them and searching/browsing the stored information in a handy, coherent way.

Droplets is very much a work in progress. The idea is to implement the following functionality:
- creating droplet cards (small notes on a fairly limited piece of information)
- linking droplets together
- adding tags on droplets
- attaching images and pdf-files on a droplet
- searching for information
..* by title or body text
..* by tag
..* by links
- registering as a user
- creating and managing teams (e.g. inviting other users to a team)
- creating and managing projects

Later, to facilitate browsing for relevant information, the following could be implemented:
- "users also looked at these" kind of way to show possibly related information
- clustering of droplets and providing additional suggestions based on proximity

## Demo

Demo version of Droplets is running on [Heroku](https://infodrops.herokuapp.com/). This is the latest version of the master branch code.
